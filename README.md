# microbit-multiplayer-snake
A lovely C++ multiplayer snake game I wrote a while back on Mbed, now being sent to Github so everyone can use it.

## Update: December 2022

Mbed has offically shut down their online compiler, so I have no idea how to compile this. The binary on the release page should work though.
